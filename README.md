# Tumului

This project is about collecting and displaying our memories for when we will be
off to a better place. We use Python 3 and Django 2 and we're licensed under the 
BSD-license.

Tumuli is centered on developing a memorial for our
friends and family.  As we are just starting, we focus on simple cases, those 
where the departed had only neglible online presense. We scan old photos and we
add meta data and develop an interface to cherish our dead.

Contribuitions are welcomed and we try to keep things newbies friendly.  We need
content, issues, comments and pull requests.  If you're a coder, the best place
to start is our issues.  Please read them and help us shrpen them by commenting.
